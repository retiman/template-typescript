    // a method actually uses instance variables or not.

    //
    // In that situation, postbuild.js is included in tsconfig.json so that JavaScript files (even ones not included
    // in the final build) should be linted according to @typescript-eslint.

    //
    // The ESLint recommendations around avoiding continue involve using if statements, which do actively degrade code
    // readability.  ESLint, for whatever reason, recommends this even when labels are not required.  Good readability,
    // in contrast, would call for using continue statements with guard clauses.
